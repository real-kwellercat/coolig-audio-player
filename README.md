# coolig-audio-player
Hardcoded audio player made with pyglet!

## what are the audio files?
The audio files are for the hardcoded music. 

drumlooptest1.mp3 is a funky drummer sample (from powerpuff girls) that I used to test the app closing when the music stops 

boppin.mp3 is [this](https://youtu.be/BbKAObQ0sao). (Lightyear by Bxnji sped up a bit)
